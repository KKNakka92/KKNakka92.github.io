Hi!



I'm a first year PhD student at CVLab, Department of Computer Science, EPFL. I'm fortunate to be supervised by [Dr. Mathieu Salzmann](https://people.epfl.ch/cgi-bin/people?id=119864&op=bio&lang=en&cvlang=en) and [Prof. Pascal Fua](https://people.epfl.ch/pascal.fua/bio?lang=en) in the areas of computer vision, deep learning.


Before joining EPFL, I was employed at Samsung Research Bangalore for 2 years developing mobile camera algoirthms. I graduated from Department of Electrical Engineering in 2015 with Dual degree (MTech in Signal Processing and BTech in Electrical Engineering).
