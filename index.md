Hi!



I'm a frsit year PhD student at CVLab, Department of Computer Science, EPFL. I'm fortunate to be supervised by [Dr. Mathieu Salzmann] and [Prof. Pascal Fua] in the areas of computer vision, deep learning.


Before joining EPFL, I was employed at Samsung Research Bangalore for 2 years.  I graduated from Department of Electrical Engineering in 2015 with Dual degree (MTech in Signal Processing and BTech in Electrical Engineering).
